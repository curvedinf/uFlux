# µFlux Specification v13

Normative for `comp/` (the `uf` compiler). The `trans/` transpiler targets the
text encoding (see final section).

**v13 is not backward compatible with v12**. See the v13 changelog section
below for the full list of breaking changes. The project is
undeployed/developmental.

µFlux is a language based on a **managed hidden stack**, compiled to C then native
via `cc`, designed for LLM-authored one-off scripts (low token count, fast,
reliable). Values flow through named local/global variables, literal constants,
and the return value of the immediately preceding op. The data stack still exists
as the runtime execution substrate, but it is managed by the compiler and runtime;
the programmer never sees or manipulates it directly. Programs are postfix
(execution order), no expression syntax.

Design pillars: small orthogonal opcode set; uniform container protocol by tag
dispatch; algorithmic efficiency by default (typed arrays, autovectorized C
loops, open-addressing hashes, Timsort, streaming channels); structured control
flow; self-contained scripts (file I/O, argv, shell-out, regex, JSON in core);
garbage-collected (scripts never `free` managed objects).

## v13 changelog

The following changes are effective as of v13:

1. **Label parameters.** A label definition declares input bindings:
   `label: a! b!` binds the caller's first pushed cell to `a`, the second to
   `b`. Callers push arguments before `_call`; structured ops pass values
   implicitly. `^name!` binds a global, `_!` discards. Arity = number of
   declared bindings; labels with no bindings have arity 0 (v12-compatible).
   Missing args bind `null`; excess cells are discarded.

2. **Explicit `ret` with stack draining.** Every code path through a label body
   must end with `ret` (compile error otherwise; bodies ending in
   `break`/`continue`/`if_else` are exempt). `ret expr` returns the operand's
   value; `ret a b c` builds a list from the operand's three values; bare `ret`
   returns `null` (or, for v12 compat, the top of the real stack if the body
   pushed something). On return, the callee's data stack is drained back to the
   caller's saved pointer and the single return value is pushed on top — every
   call boundary is self-contained.

3. **Container literals.** `[expr …]` builds a list, `{ key val … }` builds a
   dict (odd element count is a compile error), `[expr …] type array` /
   `[expr …] type tensor` build typed arrays/tensors. The brackets are ASCII
   `[` `]` `{` `}` in both encodings.

4. **Text-opcode renames.** Most text mnemonics are renamed to full English
   words or `snake_case` phrases (`len`→`length`, `push`→`append`,
   `cat`→`concat`, `clone`→`copy`, …; the complete mapping is in the opcode
   reference). `seq`/`sne` become `structural_equal`/`structural_not_equal`.
   Immediate ops are renamed (`_arr`→`_array`, `_sys`→`_syscall`,
   `_sizeof`→`_size_of`). The dense glyphs are unchanged.

5. **Inline math symbols removed.** `+`, `-`, `*`, `&` are no longer operators
   (use `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `and`). `-` appears only in number literals
   (`-5`); the dense sign/SUB lookback rule is gone.

6. **Weave rework.** Task bodies are label-shaped: `task name:` with input
   bindings, ending in `ret` (`endt` removed). `run` replaces `wrun` and may
   name a terminal task; tasks not reachable backward from the terminal are
   orphans (callable via `'name`, results not auto-computed). The `shutdown`
   op drains a running weave.

7. **New ops.** `pow`, `sqrt`, `lte`, `gte` (arithmetic/comparison) and
   `shutdown` (weave control) — five new opcodes occupying the retired slots
   13–15, 22, 24.

8. **Struct-field stride fix.** obj fields are stored as full 16-byte Cells,
   so struct layouts stride by 16 (`_size_of`/`_offset` reflect the corrected
   layout).

## Source encodings

Two encodings, identical semantics, auto-detected:

- **Dense** (`.uf`) — single-token emoji glyphs, one glyph per op. Optimized
  for the Qwen3-0.6B tokenizer (every opcode glyph, v-space atom, and l-space
  atom is a single token).
- **Text** (`.uft`) — lowercase ASCII mnemonics, whitespace-delimited.

**Detection:** any char ≥ U+13000 → dense; else text. `.uft` extension is
conventional, not required. Inline source and stdin use the same detection.
MTU files may mix encodings freely (per-TU auto-detection).

### Dense Unicode spaces

| space | range | contents |
|-------|-------|----------|
| opcodes | U+1F300+ (emoji) | 214 slots (0..213), 192 live |
| v-space | U+1F941+ interleaved with other emoji | variable/label name atoms, runs fold |
| l-space | U+1F130+ (enclosed alphanumerics) | base-64 digit atoms (self-evaluating numbers) |
| delimiters | U+13100..U+13108 | chat-template delimiters, stripped pre-compilation |
| type glyphs | U+13110..U+13117 | int, float, ptr, byte, void, handle, str, bool |

Glyph assignments are in `comp/src/lex.rs` (`OP_GLYPHS`, `V_SPACE`, `L_SPACE`).
The deprecated v7 sequential glyph aliases (U+13000..U+13037) are removed.

## Comments and strings

`;` starts a line comment in both encodings. `"..."` is a string literal with
escapes limited to `\n \t \r \0 \\ \"` (any other `\x` copies x literally).
A bare `"..."` self-evaluates (pushes a string handle).

## Numbers (l-space grammar)

l-space atoms are base-64 digits: atom U+133A4+i has digit value i (0..63).

```
number := ['-'] lrun ['.' lrun] ['e' ['-'] lrun]
lrun   := one or more l-space atoms, big-endian
```

- Bare `lrun`: self-evaluating big-endian base-64 unsigned int (becomes int
  cell; overflow past u64 is a compile error).
- `lrun '.' lrun`: fixed-point (`d1/64 + d2/4096 + …`), becomes f64 cell.
- `'e' ['-'] lrun`: multiplies by 10^exp (decimal scientific). Any number with
  `.` or `e` is a float cell.
- Leading `-`: negates (v13: always a sign — see Inline math symbols below).
- `LIT` also accepts ASCII decimal/hex (`0x..`)/float literals (including
  negatives) and type keywords, and also accepts an l-run number after it.
- Two adjacent l-runs fold into one number; generators must put whitespace
  between distinct numeric literals.

A stray `.` is a lexer error; a `-` not followed by an l-run is a lexer error
("stray '-' — use `sub`"). `e` begins an exponent only immediately after an
l-run; elsewhere it begins an ASCII identifier.

## Inline math symbols (removed in v13)

v12 allowed `+`, `-`, `*`, and `&` as inline operators for `add`, `sub`,
`mul`, and `and`. v13 removes these symbol operators: all arithmetic and
bitwise ops are written as words (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `and`, `pow`, …).

- `-` is now **only** part of a number literal. In dense mode `-` is always a
  sign and must be followed by an l-run (`-5`); a `-` followed by anything else
  is a lexer error ("stray '-'"). The v12 sign/SUB lookback rule — which
  decided between sign and SUB from the previous token's value-pushing status —
  is removed.
- In text mode a standalone `-` is a lexer error ("'-' removed in v13 — use
  `sub`; negative numbers still parse"). `-5` still parses as a negative
  number literal.
- `+`, `*`, `&` as standalone tokens are lexer errors in both encodings
  ("use `add` / `mul` / `and`").

## Names, labels, and variables (v-space)

A run of v-space atoms folds into one name. Whitespace must separate two
adjacent v-runs meant to be distinct.

Variable semantics:
- `<name>!` — store into **local** variable (call-scoped, fresh frame per CALL)
  and leave the value on the hidden stack for chaining.
- `<name>@` — push **local** variable.
- `^<name>!` / `^<name>@` — store/fetch **global** variable (static, persists
  across calls, shared across threads/TUs). `^<name>!` also leaves the value on
  the hidden stack.
- A v-run after CALL/ADDR/`'` is a label **reference**.
- Any other bare v-run is a label **definition** (no colon needed).
- ASCII `name:` still defines a label; ASCII names work as jump targets.
- IMPORT/EXPORT/EXTERN/MACRO/STRUCT names remain ASCII.

Local variables exist from first assignment until the nearest enclosing RET.
if/while/for body labels are continuations that share the caller's frame.

## Label parameters

A label definition declares input bindings in its definition; callers push
arguments before invoking the label. This makes labels user-defined ops with
the same postfix calling convention as built-ins: arguments first, then the
operation.

```
3 4 _call add2        ; 7
add2: a! b!
  ret a@ b@ add
```

Parameter bindings are the pass-through assignment tokens, written contiguously
after the label's colon:

- `name!` — bind one cell to local `name`.
- `^name!` — bind one cell to global `name`.
- `_!` — bind and discard one cell.

The first binding receives the first cell the caller pushed, the second the
second, and so on. Bindings must be contiguous at the start of the definition;
the first non-binding token ends the parameter list.

- **Arity** = the number of declared bindings. Labels with no bindings have
  arity 0 — all caller cells are discarded on entry, preserving v12 behavior.
- **Best-effort binding**: too few arguments → missing bindings receive `null`;
  excess cells are silently discarded after the bindings are satisfied.
- Structured ops pass values implicitly: `5 'body for` pushes the loop index,
  and a `body: i!` binding consumes it.

```
5 'body for
body: i!
  i@ print
  ret
```

## Return values and stack draining

Every code path through a label body must end with `ret` — falling off the end
of a label is a compile error. Bodies that end in `break`/`continue` (loop-exit
continuations) or `if_else` (which transfers control to one of two bodies) are
exempt.

`ret` takes the expression that follows it as its operand:

- `ret expr` — return the single value the operand expression leaves.
- `ret a b c` — the operand nets three values; they are combined into a list
  and that list is returned. The caller destructures it with a bind list:
  `"cmd" _call run_cmd out! err! code!`.
- Bare `ret` — return `null`; for v12 compat, if the body pushed onto the real
  stack (a value sits above the frame base), that top cell is returned instead.

```
add2: a! b!
  ret a@ b@ add

run_cmd: c!
  c@ shell out! err! code!
  ret out@ err@ code@
```

On return, the callee's **entire data stack is drained** back to the caller's
saved pointer and the single return value is pushed on top of it. The caller's
stack pointer is saved just below the arguments at every call boundary —
`_call`, structured-op callbacks, weave tasks, `spawn` bodies, `try`/`retry`
bodies, and `filter`/`array_reduce`/etc. callbacks. Callees can therefore never
leak transient values into the caller's stack.

```
0 _call foo
add             ; 0 + 0 -> 0, not 0 + 42
foo:
  42            ; pushed but never named in ret
  ret 0         ; caller sees only 0; the 42 is drained
```

Recursion uses the same call stack as structured control flow; a label calls
itself the same way it calls any other label.

## Type glyphs

U+13110..U+13117 = int(0) float(1) ptr(2) byte(3) void(4) handle(5→2)
str(6→2) bool(7→3) — handle/str are ptr aliases, bool a byte alias; void is 4
(SIZEOF void = 8, not useful).

- After `LIT`: pushes the type id.
- Directly after the type-taking immediates (`_array`/`_tensor`/`_obj`/`_cast`/
  `_size_of` in text, the corresponding glyphs in dense): type **immediate** —
  pushes the id with no LIT. The id lands on top of any preceding length, so
  ARR/TENSOR consume `[len, type]` with type on top.
- Elsewhere a bare type glyph pushes its id (expression position).
- ASCII type keywords (`int float ptr handle byte`) work in all the same
  positions; in v13 a bare type keyword pushes its type id in text mode
  (mirroring the bare type glyph in dense). `str` is not a bare keyword —
  `_str` is the immediate string op — and `void`/`bool` have no text keyword
  form.
- `array`/`tensor` are also plain ops taking `[len_or_list, type]` from the
  stack (see the opcode reference).

## Type tags

0 int, 1 float, 2 ptr, 3 byte, 4 void, 5 arr, 6 tensor, 7 list, 8 dict,
9 str, 10 chan, 11 atom, 12 buf, 13 obj, 14 bitmap, 15 time, 16 dur,
17 bloom, 18 iter.

## Runtime cell

`typedef struct { int tag; int64_t i; } Cell;` (16 bytes with alignment).
FLOAT stores the double **bit pattern** in `i`; `uf_f()` converts tag-aware.
Pointer payloads live in `i` (cast at use sites). Tagged objects (arr/tensor/
list/dict/str/chan/atom/buf/obj/bitmap/bloom) have a `{tag, len, esz}` header
preceded by a GC header. Execution state (data stack, call stack, locals) lives
in a `Ctx` so weave tasks and spawned threads each get a fresh one.

## Struct fields

`struct Name { field:type, … }` declares a record layout (OBJ). v13 stores obj
fields as full 16-byte Cells (`{tag, i}`), so every field is laid out at a
16-byte stride: consecutive scalar fields sit at offsets 0, 16, 32, … and a
struct's total size is `16 × field-count` (16 bytes minimum). `_size_of`
reports the total size and `_offset Struct.field` the field offset; both
reflect the 16-byte stride. Nested struct fields occupy the nested type's
total size (still a multiple of 16). Field access by name or offset goes
through the container protocol (`get`/`set`/`get_or_zero` with a string or int
key).

## Uniform container protocol

Six ops cover all element access, dispatched on the handle's tag:

| op | dict | list/arr/tensor | str | obj |
|----|------|-----------------|-----|-----|
| `get` | value (missing: dies) | elem at idx (OOB: dies) | byte at idx | field by name or offset |
| `get_or_zero` | 0 on miss | 0 on OOB | 0 on OOB | 0 on missing field |
| `set` | put | idx set (OOB: dies) | byte set | field set |
| `remove` | remove key (tombstone) | — | — | — |
| `contains` | key present | idx in bounds | substring found | field exists |
| `keys` | keys | — | — | field names |

`length` and `type_of` complete the protocol. A null (0) handle returns 0 from
`get_or_zero`/`contains`, dies elsewhere.

## Container literals

v13 adds compile-time literals for lists, dicts, and typed arrays/tensors. The
brackets are ASCII `[` `]` `{` `}` in **both** encodings — a deviation from the
proposal's "four new glyphs" plan: ASCII is guaranteed single-token for the
Qwen tokenizer.

- `[ expr … ]` — **list literal**. Each element expression is evaluated on the
  hidden stack and must net exactly one cell; the closing bracket consumes the
  cells and leaves one list handle.
- `{ key val … }` — **dict literal** from alternating key/value expressions.
  The element count must be even; an odd count is a compile error.
- `[ expr … ] type array` / `[ expr … ] type tensor` — **typed array/tensor
  literal**: the list is built, then `array`/`tensor` copies its elements into
  a typed array of the given element type.

```
[1 2 3] l!                        ; list
{ "a" 1 "b" 2 } d!                ; dict
[0 1 2] int array nums!           ; int array
[1.0 2.0 3.0] float tensor t!     ; float tensor
[] e!                             ; empty list
[x@ y@ z@] triplet!               ; elements may be arbitrary expressions
```

Multi-value returns inside a literal are not automatically destructured; use a
destructuring bind on the previous line if needed.

`array` and `tensor` are polymorphic in v13:

- `len type array` — v12 behavior: allocate an empty typed array of `len`
  elements.
- `list type array` — v13 behavior: allocate a typed array and copy the
  elements of `list` into it.

The same applies to `tensor`. Elements are coerced to the element type
(int/float/byte) on copy.

## Opcode reference

214 slots (0..213); 20 retired (indices 1–5, 25, 30–32, 39, 57–61, 76–77,
86–87, 151). The five v13 additions — `pow`, `sqrt`, `lte`, `gte`,
`shutdown` — occupy the previously retired slots 13–15, 22, and 24; the
remaining retired indices stay unusable. Each live opcode has a unique dense glyph; the text mnemonics are
the v13 full-word/`snake_case` names listed below. Glyph assignments are 1:1
and final in `comp/src/lex.rs`.

### Arithmetic & logic

int ops die on float/pointer operands (use CAST or `uf_f`-aware ops). `pow`,
`sqrt`, `lte`, `gte` (indices 13–15, 22) live in the core table above; they
coerce their operands via the universal coercion rules.

| idx | | mn | stack | notes |
|----|---|----|----|-------|
| 104 | 😕 | `div` | a b → a/b | int truncates toward zero; float f64. b=0: dies |
| 105 | 🚚 | `rem` | a b → a%b | C remainder (sign follows dividend). b=0: dies |
| 106 | 🤤 | `eq` | a b → 0/1 | loose equality (==); coerces per universal coercion rules |
| 212 | 🥡 | `structural_equal` | a b → 0/1 | strict equality (===); types and values must match (was `seq`) |
| 213 | 🥢 | `structural_not_equal` | a b → 0/1 | strict inequality (!==) (was `sne`) |
| 107 | 🌙 | `lt` | a b → 0/1 | numeric or string lexicographic |
| 108 | 😖 | `gt` | a b → 0/1 | as lt |
| 109 | 🚛 | `not` | a → 0/1 | 1 if a==0 |
| 110 | 🤥 | `or` | a b → a\|b | ints only |
| 111 | 🌚 | `xor` | a b → a^b | ints only |
| 112 | 😗 | `shl` | a b → a<<b | ints only; b<0 or b≥64: dies |
| 113 | 🚜 | `bnot` | a → ~a | ints only |

### Structured control flow

Compiler-resolved; quotation addresses via `'<label>`. `break`/`continue`
outside a loop are compile errors.

| idx | | mn | stack | notes |
|----|---|----|----|-------|
| 114 | 🤦 | `if` | cond body_addr → | CALL body if cond nonzero |
| 115 | 🌛 | `if_else` | cond then_addr else_addr → | (was `ifelse`) transfers control — a body may end with it |
| 116 | 😘 | `while` | cond_addr body_addr → | exit on 0, else CALL body, repeat |
| 117 | 🚢 | `break` | → | to end of nearest enclosing while/for |
| 118 | 🤧 | `continue` | → | next iteration of nearest enclosing loop (was `cont`) |

### Sequences

| idx | | mn | stack | notes |
|----|---|----|----|-------|
| 123 | 🌝 | `range` | start stop → list | ints [start, stop) |
| 124 | 😚 | `sort` | seq → seq' | Timsort (stable); list and arr |

### Vector ops (128–154, plus 169–171, 185–186)

Operate on arr/tensor of numeric element type; autovectorized C loops; results
freshly allocated; die on non-arr input. A **bitmap** (tag 14) is a dense
LSB-first u64-word array — the mask currency of the `scalar_*`/`array_*`
family.

`array_map`/`array_reduce` let the family stay compact: `vsqrt`..`vceil` are
`array_map` over an IMPORTed libm fn; windowed/grouped/cumulative reductions
are `array_reduce`.

### Time (scalar cells: time tag 15, dur tag 16, both i64 nanos)

| 89 | 🚖 | `execute` | list → status | no shell; list is argv (elem 0 = program) (was `exec`) |

### Strings & regex

All results freshly allocated. Indices are **byte** indices. Embedded
backtracking regex engine (no dependencies).

Regex syntax: literals; `\` escape; `.` any char except EOS; `*` `+` `?` greedy
(with backtracking); `[...]` char classes (ranges, negation `[^...]`, `]`
first is literal); `^` start anchor, `$` end anchor; `|` alternation; `(...)`
capture groups (max 9, group 0 = whole match). Malformed pattern = runtime die.

| idx | | mn | stack | notes |

### Large-data & graph ops

No file-handle object type; every op is self-contained.

| idx | | mn | stack | notes |
|----|---|----|----|-------|
| 172 | 🌫 | `mmap` | path → str | read-only zero-copy string; GC-unmapped on sweep. All string ops work |

### JSON

### Iterators (tag 18)

Single-use, mutable cursors. Every collection is iterable.

| idx | | mn | stack | notes |
|----|---|----|----|-------|
| 192 | 🌱 | `iter` | h → it | list/arr/tensor (elems), dict (keys), str (bytes), chan (until close), bitmap (set-bit indices) |
| 193 | 😫 | `next` | it → list | returns `[value, more]`; exhausted → `[0, 0]`; non-iter: dies |
| 194 | 🛋 | `collect` | it → list | drain into fresh list |

| 196 | 🌲 | `iter_filter` | it pred_addr → it' | lazy filter; pred (v → 0/1) (was `ifilter`) |
| 197 | 😬 | `file_emit` | path it → n | stream any iterable to file, one item per line; returns count (was `femit`) |

### Error containment & threads

| idx | | mn | stack | notes |
|----|---|----|----|-------|
| 198 | 🛌 | `try` | body_addr → list | returns `[result, ok]`; success → `[value, 1]`, die → `[0, 0]` |
| 199 | 🤾 | `retry` | n body_addr → list | same as `try`; try up to n+1 times |
| 200 | 🌳 | `spawn` | body_addr → chan | detached thread; body must end with `ret`, whose value is enqueued + chan closed at body end; `dequeue` = join |

`die` unwinds to the nearest `setjmp` checkpoint pushed by `try`/`retry` (they
nest); with no checkpoint, `die` is fatal. No backoff, jitter, or exception
typing — count and containment are the whole policy.

### Conversion

### Script convenience (207–210)

| idx | | mn | stack | notes |
|----|---|----|----|-------|

| 211 | 🥘 | `range_reduce` | count init label → scalar | fold over range 0..count; label `(acc i → acc)` called per iteration (was `rangefold`) |

### Modules & directives

| idx | | mn | notes |
|----|---|----|-------|
| 78 | 😏 | `use` | `use"name"` — link `-l<name>`, load `mods/<name>.ufm` |
| 79 | 🚔 | `mod` | `mod"name"` — translation-unit name |
| 80 | 🤞 | `pub` | export next label to global namespace |
| 81 | 🌐 | `weave` | begin task scope |
| 82 | 😐 | `task` | begin task body (inside weave): `task name:` with input bindings |
| 84 | 🤟 | `run` | schedule the DAG, wait; optional terminal task name (was `wrun`) |

`endt` (index 83) is removed in v13 — task bodies end with an explicit `ret`.

## Reflection

`type_of h → tag`, `length h → n` (generalized), `keys h → list` (dict keys or
obj field names). OBJ objects carry a tag header (tag obj, struct id); field
access by name or offset goes through the container protocol. CAST is checked
(compares struct id, dies on mismatch). Dynamic dispatch (v9 SEND/METHOD) is
removed.

## Modules: USE and binding manifests

`use"name"`: links `-l<name>` and loads the binding manifest `<name>.ufm`,
searched in `./mods`, `~/.uflux/mods`, then `$UFMODPATH` dirs. A manifest is a
µFlux file containing IMPORT/EXTERN/STRUCT lines; compiled as part of the
USEing TU. Ships: `m.ufm`, `c.ufm`, `pthread.ufm`, `curl.ufm`, `sdl2.ufm`,
`ssl.ufm`. `-lpthread -lm` always linked; additional `-l<name>` per USE.

### FFI details

- `import c"fn"(types)->ret` — declares an unprototyped C function; args cast
  at call site. Generated C aliases the symbol (`__asm__`), so libc names
  already prototyped by the prelude are safe to import. Varargs: declare fixed
  params then `...` (e.g. `import c"printf"(ptr,...)->int`); format string is
  deepest, varargs above. `->int` is C `int` (32-bit), sign-extended into the
  64-bit cell.
- `extern "symbol"` — pushes the address of a global C symbol for use with
  `load`/`store`. Runtime exposes `uf_argc` and `uf_argv` this way (though
  `argv` op 163 is preferred).

## Multiple translation units (MTU)

`uf main.uf lib.uf ...`: first input is the main TU (execution starts at its pc
0; a TU's top-level flow never falls into the next TU). Per-TU:

- Optional `MOD"name"` header; default is filename stem. Glyph v-names, ASCII
  labels, global variables (`^name`), and macros are file-local. Local
  variables are call-scoped.
- `PUB` before a label exports it to the global namespace; CALL/`'` resolve PUB
  names across TUs. Duplicate PUB = compile error. STRUCTs, IMPORT/EXTERN/USE
  are global (deduped).
- Encodings may be mixed (per-TU auto-detection).
- Implementation: per-TU lex+parse, one merged codegen, one C file, one cc run.

## Directory mode and init threads

Bare `uf` (or `uf somedir/`) discovers source files:

- **Root**: `main.uf`/`main.uft` is the entry point (first TU, pc 0). Error if
  not found. Other `*.uf`/`*.uft` in root are additional TUs.
- **Subdirectory with `init.uf`/`init.uft`**: compiled as TUs; the init file is
  flagged as an init TU — its top-level code runs in a separate thread,
  automatically spawned before main starts. Recurses into nested init subdirs.
- **Subdirectory without init**: ignored. `mods/` is never scanned.

Init threads are detached pthreads; each gets its own `Ctx`. Global variables
(`^name`) are shared across all threads. Coordination via chans and PUB/CALL.

Explicit-file mode is unchanged — no discovery, no init threads.

## Garbage collection

Precise, non-moving, stop-the-world mark-sweep. Handle stability (a handle is
never invalidated by a collection) keeps FFI, chan buffers, and weave task
results trivially safe.

- **Heap objects**: every tagged object allocated with a GC header, linked into
  a global list. Bodies holding cells (list/dict/arr/chan/obj) are scanned for
  children during marking; str/bitmap/bloom are leaf bytes.
- **Roots**: each `Ctx`'s data and call stacks, all global variables (`^name`),
  active local-variable frames, weave task results, chan queue contents.
  Registers/C-stack are never roots (interpreter holds handles only inside cells).
- **Untagged pointers** (`malloc`, `buffer`): never traced, never freed by GC.
- **Trigger**: bytes allocated since last collection exceeds threshold (default:
  max(1 MiB, 2× live bytes)), and explicit `gc` op (50). Adjustable via
  `UF_GC_THRESHOLD` env var or `--gc-threshold` runtime flag.
- **Concurrency**: stop-the-world via global GC mutex; weave workers park at
  allocation safepoints. Collections never start mid-weave join.
- **Non-goals**: compaction, generations, incremental/concurrent marking.

## Concurrency — weave

`weave` is the single construct for task graphs, servers, and composable
multithreaded processes. v13 task bodies are label-shaped: a task is introduced
by `task name:` (with optional input bindings after the colon) and ends with an
explicit `ret`.

```
weave
  task a:
    ret 1
  task b: a!
    ret a@ 2 add
run
```

- **Task bodies** use label syntax. `task name:` introduces a task; the body
  must end with `ret` (falling off the end is a compile error, exactly like a
  label). Bare `ret` returns `null`. The value named in `ret` becomes the task
  result; with fanout, each worker's `ret` value becomes one element of the
  published result list. `endt` is removed.
- **Inputs** are parameter bindings after the colon: `task b: a!` makes task
  `a`'s result available as local parameter `a`; `^name!` binds a global,
  `_!` discards. Bindings are evaluated left-to-right, matching the label
  parameter convention.
- **Fanout**: a numeric literal 1..64 before `task` declares the worker count:
  `4 task worker: item!`. Only the **first** input drives fanout and must be
  iterable (list/arr/tensor/chan/iter); additional inputs are broadcast
  (copied unchanged into every worker). Distribution is dynamic — items flow
  through an internal bounded chan and workers pull, so cheap workers never sit
  idle behind slow ones. A chan input drains until close; other iterables until
  exhaustion. Published result is a **list of per-item results in completion
  order**. Empty input → empty list. Count > 1 requires ≥1 input.
- **Static DAG**: task inputs must name tasks in the same weave block; unknown
  input or cycle = compile error. Task bodies are self-contained (labels
  task-local; two tasks may reuse v-names). Global variables (`^name`) cross
  task boundaries; local variables are per-task.
- **`run [terminal]`**: `run` with no name executes every task (v12
  compatibility) and leaves the last task's result on the stack. `run <name>`
  names a terminal task: the compiler walks the DAG backward from the terminal
  and executes only reachable tasks. Tasks not reachable from the terminal are
  **orphans** — they stay in scope, remain callable via `'name` at runtime, but
  their results are not auto-computed. The terminal's result is left on the
  stack after `run`.

  ```
  weave
    task data:
      ret 3
    task process: data!
      ret data@ 2 mul
    task summary: data! process!
      ret data@ process@ add
    task orphan:
      ret 999        ; not reachable from `summary` — never runs
  run summary        ; 9
  ```

- **`shutdown`** (op 24, no return value) inside any task sets the weave's
  drain flag: running tasks finish, the weave joins all running tasks, and
  `run` returns; tasks that never started stay pending (their results remain
  unset). After `shutdown`, execution continues until the task's `ret`. In
  server weaves it is typically called from a request handler when a shutdown
  path is hit.

  ```
  weave
    task serve:
      0 ^n!
      'more 'step while
      ret
    more:
      ret ^n@ 100 lt
    step:
      ^n@ 1 add ^n!
      ^n@ 100 gte 'shut if
      ret
    shut:
      shutdown
      ret
  run
  ```

- **Runtime**: worker pool of `min(total declared workers, ncpu)` pthreads plus
  the calling thread. Each task runs with fresh data and call stacks; inputs
  are copied in as the initial stack in declared order. `spawn` target labels
  are ordinary labels subject to the same mandatory-`ret` rule.
- **Timing**: `UF_WEAVE_DEBUG` env var prints per-task wall time, declared
  workers, items processed, retries, tolerated failures to stderr.

`spawn` (200): run the target label on a detached thread with a fresh `Ctx`;
returns a cap-1 chan immediately. The label body must end with `ret` (falling
off the end is a compile error); its return value is enqueued and the chan
closed at body end — `dequeue` on it is a join. Bare `ret` returns `null`. An
uncontained `die` in a spawned thread kills the process.

## Text encoding

Lowercase ASCII mnemonics, whitespace-delimited. Same Tok AST as dense.

- Tokens split on whitespace; `;` comments; `"..."` strings may contain spaces.
  `-` alone is a lexer error ("use `sub`"), `-5` is a number (no lookback
  rule). `+`, `*`, `&` are lexer errors ("use `add` / `mul` / `and`").
- Bare decimal/hex/float literals self-evaluate; `_lit` stays for type ids and
  numbers.
- Names: label def `name:`, refs `'name`, variables `name!`/`name@` (any
  identifier). Opcode mnemonics are reserved words.
- v13 mnemonics are full English words or `snake_case` phrases; the complete
  mapping is in the opcode reference tables above.
- `--emit-text` / `--emit-dense` round-trip between encodings. `--to-text` /
  `--to-dense` convert (writes `<stem>.uft` / `<stem>.uf`, `-o` overrides).

## PRINT and SCAN

- **PRINT** (54): `v →`. `print` consumes the top-of-stack value and emits a
  type-aware, recursive representation. Top-level strings are printed raw (no
  quotes); nested strings and non-string values are rendered with unambiguous
  formatting. For formatted output, build a string with `format` and then
  `print` it.
- **SCAN** (55): `fmt → list`. Each conversion reads stdin via fscanf:
  `%d/%i/%u/%x/%o` → i64, `%f/%e/%g` → f64, `%s` → fresh string handle. The
  returned list holds the converted values followed by the count. Input error
  aborts. Destructure with `list N get` or a bind list.

## Universal coercion

v13 keeps v12's uniform coercion: strict per-op type checking is replaced by
coercion based on the context in which a value is used. The rules are the same
for every op; there are no per-op exceptions.

### Numeric context

`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `rem`, comparisons, and vector ops coerce operands
to numbers:

| Input | Result |
|-------|--------|
| int `42` | `42` |
| float `3.14` | `3.14` |
| str `"42"` | `42` |
| str `"0x1A"` | `26` |
| str `""` / whitespace | `0` |
| str `"hello"` | `NaN` |
| null / `0` handle | `0` |
| bool | `1` or `0` |
| list `[x]` | unwrap single element, then coerce |
| list `[]` | `0` |
| list `[x y …]` / dict / obj | `NaN` |

`NaN` propagates through arithmetic. Ops that must produce an integer truncate
`NaN` at the point of use, which is a die.

### String context

`concat`, `join`, `split`, `format`, and string ops coerce operands to strings:

| Input | Result |
|-------|--------|
| int | decimal string |
| float | decimal string or `"NaN"` |
| null / `0` handle | `"null"` |
| bool | `"true"` / `"false"` |
| list | `"1,2,3"` style join |
| list `[]` | `""` |
| dict / obj | `"[object Object]"` |

### Truthiness

`if`, `if_else`, `while`, `filter`, `any`, `all`, and bitmap ops use JS-style
truthiness. Falsy values: `0`, `""`, `null`, `NaN`, and empty collections.
Everything else is truthy (`1`).

### Equality

- `eq` uses loose equality (`==`): `"3" eq 3` → `1`, `null eq 0` → `1`.
- `structural_equal` uses strict equality (`===`): types and values must match.
- `structural_not_equal` is strict inequality.
- `lt`/`gt` coerce both sides to Number for comparison.

### Collection coercion

Vector ops expecting `arr` coerce lists, dict values, strings (char codes),
bitmaps (set-bit indices), and scalars (single-element array). Bitmap ops coerce
collection elements to bits via truthiness.

### When coercion dies

Only when the result is genuinely undefined, never on input type:

- Integer truncation of `NaN` or `Infinity` (`div`, `rem`).
- `mean` / `min` / `max` on empty collection.
- Length mismatch in elementwise ops (`array_add`, etc.).

## Concrete grammar

Whitespace/comments skipped between tokens. Chat delimiters U+13100..13108
stripped anywhere.

```
program      := token*
token        := number | string | literal | varset | varget | labeldef | jump | op | directive
number       := ['-'] lrun ['.' lrun] ['e' ['-'] lrun]
             ; text mode also accepts ASCII decimal/hex/float literals
string       := '"' ... '"'
literal      := '[' token* ']' [<type> ('array' | 'tensor')]
             | '{' token* '}'           ; dict literal; element count must be even
name         := [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*    ; must NOT start with '_' (reserved for _-prefixed ops)
varset       := ['^'] name ('!' | setv-glyph)   ; store and pass through
varget       := ['^'] name ('@' | getv-glyph)
labeldef     := name ':' [param]*       ; params (v13): name! | ^name! | _!
             | name                      ; label def without colon
jump         := (_call | "'") name
op           := opcode-glyph | text-mnemonic
             ; text mode: immediate-operand ops are _-prefixed — see section below
             ; v12: dup, ovr, drop, swp, pick are retired
             ; v13: + - * & symbol operators removed; `-` only in number literals
directive    := import c"name"(params)->ret | export "name" | extern "sym"
             | macro name { token* } | struct name { field:type, … }
             | use "name" | mod "name" | pub <labeldef>
             | weave task* run [name]
task         := [<count>] task name ':' token*   ; body must end with ret
```

`ret` is a prefix keyword: `ret [expr]` where the operand expression runs until
the next statement boundary (label, directive, task, another `ret`, or a
literal closer). `ret a b c` builds a list from the operand's values.

A sequence of consecutive `varset` tokens after a multi-return op is a
**destructuring bind**: each `name!` binds the next slot of the returned tuple,
and `_!` discards a slot. Bind arity need not match tuple length; excess binds
receive `null` and unbound trailing slots are auto-discarded.

Quotation-taking ops (if/if_else/while/for, try/retry, filter/any/all,
array_map/array_reduce, iter_map/iter_filter, file_each_line/file_fold_lines,
bfs/dfs/find_first, spawn, group_by/aggregate, fanout bodies) take label
addresses on the hidden stack — written `'<label>` — resolved by the compiler.
`break`/`continue` valid only inside a lexically enclosing `while`/`for` body
in the same function (compile error otherwise).

## Immediate-operand opcodes (_-prefixed, text mode only)

Opcodes starting with `_` take a **compile-time immediate**: the next source
token is consumed as a label name, type name, or numeric operand at compile
time. The immediate operand never touches the runtime stack — the value it
denotes is baked into the generated code or resolved to an address by the
compiler.

All other opcodes operate purely on the runtime stack.

This makes the distinction visible at a glance: `_call foo` consumes the
token `foo` as a label reference, whereas `add` reads its inputs from the
hidden stack at run time.

User-defined identifiers (variables, labels) may **not** start with `_` —
the prefix is reserved for these opcodes.

Dense/glyph mode is unaffected: glyphs dispatch by codepoint, not by name,
so no prefix is needed (or possible) there.

| mnemonic | opcode | immediate operand | stack effect |
|----------|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| `_lit` | LIT | number / type glyph / type keyword | → v |
| `_call` | CALL | label name | call (see notes) |
| `_addr` | ADDR | label name (`'label`) | → code address |
| `_syscall` | SYS | syscall number | args… num → ret |
| `_str` | STR | string literal | → h |
| `_size_of` | SIZEOF | type name / Struct name | type → n |
| `_offset` | OFFSET | `Struct.field` | → n |
| `_obj` | OBJ | type name (struct id) | → h |
| `_cast` | CAST | type name (struct id) | h type → h |
| `_array` | ARR | type name | len → h |
| `_tensor` | TENSOR | type name | len → h |

## Codegen notes

Pipeline: tokens → parser (labels/macros/structs/imports/v13 locals) → C with
computed-goto threaded interpreter → `cc -O2 -w`.

CLI modes: `uf prog.uf` (compile + run, cached binary in `$TMPDIR/uflux-cache/`);
`uf -c prog.uf -o bin` (compile only); `uf --emit-c prog.uf` (dump C); `--emit-text`/
`--emit-dense` (encoding conversion); `--to-text`/`--to-dense` (convert). First
positional arg is a file if it exists, otherwise inline source. Everything after
`--` is forwarded as program argv.

**`--debug` / `-D`**: compiles in debug mode (`cc -O0 -g`). Disables local-variable
register caching so locals are always memory-resident and accurate. On any fatal
runtime error (`die()`), prints a crash dump to stderr with: call stack (label
names + PCs), local variables per frame (names + values), and global variables
(names + values). In normal mode, no metadata tables are emitted and `die()`
behaves as before. Debug binaries are cached separately.

Always-on (non-debug) error messages include the operation name and stack depth:
e.g. `stack underflow in op_print (sp=0)`, `stack overflow in op_push (sp=1048576)`.

Codegen optimizations (`comp/src/gen.rs`):
- **Basic-block stack virtualization**: within straight-line blocks, ds push/pop
  become C locals; spilled to real ds at jump targets and control-flow edges.
- **Type specialization**: when both arithmetic operands have known types,
  emits raw C arithmetic (no tag checks), enabling SSE/autovectorization.
- **FOR inlining**: a FOR preceded by ADDR of a compile-time-known label, whose
  body is structurally inlinable, becomes a direct C `for` loop over a renamed
  inline copy. Depth cap 8.
- **Deferred variable stores**: SETV writes a temp cache within a block; dirty
  temps flushed at block boundaries.

Linking: always `-lpthread -lm` plus `-l<name>` per USE.

## Totals

214 opcode slots (0..213); 20 retired indices (never reused); **192 live
opcodes**. The five v13 additions — `pow`, `sqrt`, `lte`, `gte`, `shutdown` —
occupy the previously retired slots 13–15, 22, and 24. Every live opcode has a
unique dense glyph codepoint.

## C → µFlux transpiler (trans/)

`trans/trans.uf` is a C-subset → µFlux transpiler, self-hosted in µFlux (text
encoding). Bootstrapped via `gen_trans.py`. Supported subset, libc IMPORT
preamble, and coreutils test adaptations (`true`, `false`, `echo`, `yes`, `wc`)
are documented in `trans/README.md`.
