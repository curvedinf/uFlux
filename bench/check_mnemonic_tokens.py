"""Check which µFlux text op mnemonics are single Qwen3-0.6B tokens, in both
the trailing-space form ('lit ') and the leading-space form (' lit') that the
GPT-2-style BPE actually uses to represent a word mid-document.

The leading-space form ('Ġlit') is the token that actually appears when the
benchmark tokenizes a .uft source, because in this BPE scheme a space attaches
to the FOLLOWING token as a leading marker."""
